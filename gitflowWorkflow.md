# Gitflow Workflow

Use [Gitflow workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows#gitflow-workflow) for software development.

Branching model:

- `master`
- `develop`
- `<feature-branch>`: Work is done on feature branches that are forked off of `develop`

All source code should be code reviewed by making a pull-request before it is merged to `master` or `develop` branch
